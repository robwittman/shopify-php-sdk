 * Discounts (or discount codes) can be created, disabled, enabled and destroyed
 * through the Shopify API.
 *
 * A merchant's customers can enter the discount code during the checkout process
 * to redeem percentage-based, fixed amount, or free shipping discounts on a
 * specific product, collection or order. Usually, discount codes are delivered
 * to a customer by the merchant through an email marketing campaign, direct email,
 * or offline marketing.
