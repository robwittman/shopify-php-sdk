 * Shop owners can specify which country or countries they will ship to and these
 * countries are made available through the API using the country resource. Shop
 * owners can do this by navigating to the "Preferences" tab under "Regions & Taxes."
 * If any of those countries have states or provinces, those states or provinces
 * are also registered as shipping destinations, each of which can have its own
 * state or provincial sales tax.
